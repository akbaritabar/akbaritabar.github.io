<h3><span class="header-section-number">8.3.1</span> Gender</h3>
<p>There are three streams of literature on the issue of lower productivity of females compared to males in science, which is coined as <em>productivity puzzle</em> <span class="citation">(Cole and Zuckerman <a href="#ref-cole1984productivity">1984</a>)</span>. See also <span class="citation">Abramo, D’Angelo, and Caprasecca (<a href="#ref-abramo2009gender">2009</a><a href="#ref-abramo2009gender">b</a>)</span>’s note in their review:</p>
<ul>
<li>Literature suggesting smaller number of females entering the field (so a self-selection bias like in <span class="citation">Sheltzer and Smith (<a href="#ref-sheltzer2014elite">2014</a>)</span> and <span class="citation">Hancock and Baum (<a href="#ref-hancock2010women">2010</a>)</span>)</li>
<li>Literature with a feminist tendency suggesting unequal opportunity and sexual discrimination (like case of political sciences in <span class="citation">Teele and Thelen (<a href="#ref-teele2017gender">2017</a>)</span>)</li>
<li>Literature with a focus on productivity measurement and explanation mentioning that females perform less than males (based on bibliometric evidences, e.g., case of Italy in <span class="citation">Abramo, D’Angelo, and Caprasecca (<a href="#ref-abramo2009gender">2009</a><a href="#ref-abramo2009gender">b</a>)</span>)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span class="citation">Teele and Thelen (<a href="#ref-teele2017gender">2017</a>)</span> </strong></p>
<p>They look at the publications in 10 prominent political science journals, searching for gender bias and under-representation of females in the pages of these journals.
They differentiate between team of authors in paper level analysis, based on gender to <em>all-male</em>, <em>all-female</em> teams, <em>solo male</em> and <em>female</em> authors and <em>cross collaborations</em>. They were not the first in literature to do this gender composition differentiation, there were studies doing so before e.g., <span class="citation">Young (<a href="#ref-young1995assessment">1995</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">Maliniak, Powers, and Walter (<a href="#ref-maliniak2013gender">2013</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>They controlled for share of females in the profession (by APSA association membership) and they observed that the low percentage of female authors (in published papers) does not follow the trend in APSA members.</p>
<p>Coauthorships were more happening among <em>all male teams</em> and when they controlled for research methods, these journals had a tendency to publish more <em>quantitative</em> work rather than <em>qualitative</em>. They claim that is the type of research females are more likely to do (which this tendency has been discussed as a probable self-selection bias or an unconscious structural effect leading females to first take qualitative educational fields and then end up doing this type of research and then lead to have a leakier academic career pipeline <span class="citation">(Hancock and Baum <a href="#ref-hancock2010women">2010</a>)</span>).</p>
<p><strong><span class="citation">Kretschmer et al. (<a href="#ref-kretschmer2012gender">2012</a>)</span> </strong></p>
<p>Authors in this article have tried to test the general notion stating gender bias in science is related to the <em>subject of research</em>. They have studied some of the main <em>gender studies</em> journals to see whether female authors were still under-represented in these journals. They found a strikingly high share of female authors which was not comparable to other journals (e.g., PNAS).</p>
<p><strong><span class="citation">Maliniak, Powers, and Walter (<a href="#ref-maliniak2013gender">2013</a>)</span> </strong></p>
<p>They claim that after studying journals in political science, while controlling for other variables, articles written by female authors received less citations than articles by males.</p>
<p>They have done a network analysis and found that female authors’ articles were less central in the network of papers citing each other, as a proxy of papers interaction through impact. Male authors tended to cite male authors more, female authors tended to cite female authors less.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a cause for concern, If women in IR are systematically cited
less than men in ways that do not appear to be associated with observable differences in their scholarship, and if citation counts continue to be used as a key measure of research impact, then women will be disadvantaged in tenure, promotion, and salary decisions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong><span class="citation">Young (<a href="#ref-young1995assessment">1995</a>)</span> </strong></p>
<p>She started her narrative by figures of increase in number of females in classrooms in different levels of universities. After she discussed <em>how</em> and <em>where</em> females were publishing their papers in political sciences.</p>
<p>Interestingly she looked at these elements in paper level analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li>How frequently females publish?</li>
<li>How frequently they are single, lead and secondary authors?</li>
<li>Are percentages consistent across journals and over time?</li>
</ul>
<p>Length of text and topics of articles by females are compared to those by male authors. It is also used as a potential explanation of the differences in trends of publishing, as working on different subjects. Order of names of authors is studied further in each paper controlling whether it is <em>in</em> or <em>out of alphabetical order</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Membership in national association implies commitment to the profession. The sad conclusion is, because women publish less frequently and because men are unlikely to cite female-authored articles, few women are perceived to be top researchers in the field (Klingemann, groffman, and campagna 1989).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They reviewed the literature on differences of research productivity between male and female scientists and the puzzle of lower productivity of females. Their answer to this puzzle and if they were able to solve it, is both yes and no.</p>
<p>They have found that females scientists are <em>publishing less</em> because of personal characteristics, structural positions and facilitating resources that are conductive to publication. Beside that, they claim that there is a second puzzle. Puzzle of <em>different career trajectories</em> between males and females in science. Structural resources favor females less. Overall sex differences in research productivity is declined in recent years (until their publication in 1998).</p>
<p>In their regression results, they have a variable as <em>type of current institution</em> which has <em>high quality university</em> to <em>low quality four-year college</em>. This seemed to control for ivy-league effect of institutions.</p>

<p>Participation of females in the labor force and academic labor in Eastern Europe has been higher than Northern America or Western European countries and more equal to males. She mentions that accessibility of scientific career for females in USA has been 22% in 1995. But regardless of higher accessibility, female scientists in East European countries had marginal professional positions.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Female researchers achieve academic degrees and high(est) academic ranks more rarely and slowly, which makes their qualification structure poorer than the corresponding structure of male scientists</li>
<li>Female scientists fall behind their male counterparts in other kinds of collegial recognition, as well: employment at prominent universities and other scientific institutions, prestigious scholarships, permanent tenure, scientific awards</li>
<li>Women hold relatively few positions of influence in scientific institutions: they even hold few supervisory positions in organization units, not to mention running an entire scientific institution</li>
<li>Exceedingly few female scientists participate in the scientific power structure. This refers equally to their participation in prestigious and influential bodies of national academies, scientific societies, and in advisory and/or editorial boards of scientific journals, i.e., in the bodies that channel scientific development, and in high-level societal and political bodies that design scientific and technological policy</li>
<li>Women are paid less in science (often for the same job) than their male counterparts</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Gender differences in productivity are therefore far from constant and stable. They are sensitive to the time frame, so research should include their trends of development.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interestingly (page 35), she cites literature that female scientists generally come from higher socio-economic statuses compared to their male counterparts. Since it is harder for them to get into scientific careers than males, so they belong to higher status families and they have different images of scientific career in mind when they start it.</p>
<p>She concludes that although increased productivity of young Croatian scientists is due to the fact that overall number of publications of both male and female scientists increased in the newer generation, but, she finds that the rate and speed of increase in publications in males are higher than females. Males are more ready to adopt to changing system of academia with higher competition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Men more readily accepted the new standards of scientific production introduced by changes in the system of evaluating scientific work. The theoretic implication of this is that gender differentiation in productivity is not only reflected in the number of publications, but as the different adjustment of scientific performance to new conditions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In conclusions she emphasizes the results of psychological research:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Psychological research to date indirectly indicates that the smaller productivity of women scientists is socially generated, because no significant differences were found in the intellectual abilities of women and men who enter science, or stay in it. Gender differences in scientific productivity may potentially also arise from insufficiently investigated and identified psychological characteristics – such as personality, motivation, values and interests of male and female scientists – but these seem to be impregnated with cultural and social influences too.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong><span class="citation">Preston (<a href="#ref-preston1994have">1994</a>)</span> </strong></p>
<p>Investigates why females tend to leave a scientific career twice more their male counterparts. They mention striking historical numbers from females employment in science:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1982, women represented 22 percent of employed natural scientists, 29 percent of employed social scientists, and 3 percent of employed engineers (NSF Resource Series 87-322) (cite: Survey of doctoral recipients. Surveys of Science Resource Series, Washington, DC: National Science Foundation, 1977-
1986)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The conventional explanation that females exit academic (scientific) labor force due to maternity and childbearing responsibilities is incomplete, and they find out that this exit happens more often in early stages of career.</p>
<p><strong><span class="citation">Stack (<a href="#ref-stack2004gender">2004</a>)</span> </strong></p>
<p>This is one of the rare studies that have looked at academics’ children ages and their research productivity to see if having a child (with different ages) can lower the productivity. They have then looked at gender differences for more than 11 thousand PhD recipients hired in academic jobs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Research on gender and scholarly productivity, the productivity puzzle, has neglected analysis of the influence of children on scientists’ research productivity (e.g., Blackburn and Lawrence, 1995; Keith, 2002; Stack, 1994a, 2002a; Xie and Schuman, 1998, 2003)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They cite two previous studies who have looked at the same subject with data on children and research productivity (in conclusion section):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This finding was consistent with those of two studies from a quarter century ago. Hargens et al. (1978), in a study of 96, married PhD Chemists, found that gender influenced productivity independent of children. Hamovitch and Morgenstern (1977) found similar results, but included PhDs who were not in the paid labor force. Such persons tend not to have the same level of motivation and do not receive rewards publishing as do employed academics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They found that young children are associated with higher productivity (after controlling covariates of productivity). They mention some limitations (at the end of conclusion), such as flexibility of academic jobs.</p>
<p><strong><span class="citation">Leahey (<a href="#ref-leahey2006gender">2006</a>)</span> </strong></p>
<p>Females specialize less in their research activity and this causes (in interaction with gender) for them to have lower research productivity. She claims that during this long history of research on research productivity, <em>specialization</em> has been under-studied and neglected and her study is one of the first to look at its effect. Based on what she found, having a specialized research program and writing papers in the same specialty area repeatedly promotes productivity.</p>
<p>In conclusions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Men’s and women’s different professional networks and collaboration strategies may also be relevant. Men’s wider and more diverse professional networks (Burt 1998; Kanter 1977) may allow them to find collaborators whose interests overlap their own, allowing their research collaborations to reinforce their expertise in one or a few specialty areas, whereas women’s smaller and more homogeneous professional networks (Grant and Ward 1991; Renzulli, Aldrich, and Moody 2000) require them to branch out to other substantive areas if they want to collaborate, resulting in more diversified research programs.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I found the processes by which specialization mediates gender differences in productivity to be roughly the same in two fields typically neglected by the sociology of science: sociology and linguistics (Guetzkow, Lamont, and Mallard 2004). However, gender effects were more pronounced in sociology - a field with many ill-defined core areas <span class="citation">(Dogan and Pahre <a href="#ref-dogan1989fragmentation">1989</a>)</span> - than in linguistics</p>

<p>They studied gender differences mentioned in literature in Italian academic system and they found that females have lower research productivity.

<p>She first presents figures of how females has entered the labor force and male dominated jobs like <em>law</em>, <em>medicine</em> and <em>university teaching</em>. Then she cites literature on how scholars have looked at this tremendous change of century and how it can change the nature of academic profession. At the same time she cites a work that females are hired for lower positions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dr. Benjamin drew on the accumulated data from the AAUP’s annual academic salary surveys and observed that the increased participation of women was “disproportionately in the lower ranks and shows scant evidence of progression through the ranks.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She asks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are women taking over the professions? If so, how? If not, could at least the nature of the professions be changing by virtue of the increasing presence of women in them? The purpose of this article is to address these questions by focusing on one such profession - college and university teaching.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the notion of “<em>Academic labor market or markets</em>” she mentions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The reference to academic labor markets in the plural here is deliberate. For as Michael McPherson [21, p. 57] has observed “Ph.D.s are highly specialized personnel. Employment conditions differ very widely among disciplines and even among sub-disciplines.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In answering her question on “have females changed the nature of the academic profession?”, she claims on the supply side the change has clearly happened. But on the academic ranks and positions which females have occupied, it has happened mostly been on the places were traditionally males were avoiding, such as lower ranked, lower paid positions with not much future prospects. She concludes by mentioning the increasing hardship of following an academic job for both males and females. An advice by academics to young generation; answering survey questions: “don’t do it, this is not a good time”. But she also mentions that increase in females presence in academic positions differs by fields of science. It is higher in humanities and social sciences compared to hard sciences.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In this study we sought to verify the hypothesis that researcher’s gender affects evaluation of his or her work, especially in a field where women only represent a minority.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They found that gender of author matters for evaluation of a paper, but seemingly not their age. Beside that, they found that this discrimination is not intentional and can be unconscious:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fraction of guesses that a male-authored paper had been published was 30.6% (14 pct. points) higher than for female-authored ones. If anything, this effect was stronger in female than male subjects. This would represent a clear case of statistical discrimination, in line with the claim of Moss-Racusin et al. (2012) that lack of evidence of (male) in-group favouritism “suggests that <em>the bias</em> is likely <em>unintentional</em>, generated from widespread cultural stereotypes rather than a conscious intention to harm women”</p>

<p>They wanted to compare the objective and subjective image of PhD students toward their career prospects.

And they want to relate the childbearing behavior of female scientists with their ideals and subjective idea of how many children they want to have.

</blockquote>
<p>They have reviewed data of research institutes websites and counted the number of male and female PhD and post-docs that are hired compared by the gender of supervisor.
They have found that male faculty members hire less female graduate students and post-docs than female faculty members did.
Then they have separated prestigious (elite) scientists and looked at their hiring behavior too.
They have found that male prestigious scientists tend to train less females compared to other male scientists.
While female prestigious scientists do not show a gender bias in hiring.
They found that new assistant professors of these departments are mostly postdoctoral researchers from these departments, so the above trend gets reproduced in new faculty hiring as well.
They comment that this observation might be due to exclusion of females or self selected absence of females.</p>

<p>Observing and finding gender differences is good and necessary, and it can signal a discrimination going on, but we can not make sure in explanation unless we look and control for probable self-selection bias by females not to continue an academic career, or different amount of effort and talent (if we can measure it) or differences in educational level or in case of analyzing publications, it can be a discrimination happening by the gatekeeper effect of journal editors and peer review process dysfunctions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gender differences might arise because women and men, faced with the same options and opportunities, have made different choices or investments in their careers; or gender differences might arise because of discrimination at some other level, for instance among journal editors and funding sources or during the educational process. Thus, a finding of gender differences in the hiring and promotion of females in a particular academic field is a necessary <em>but clearly not sufficient condition of discrimination</em>, flagging areas of potential concern.</p>

<p>They start with claiming that teams (working on scientific projects) can benefit from different kinds of diversity, like scientific discipline, work experience, gender, ethnicity and nationality.
But they add that <em>it is not enough</em> to add females to the groups and wait for innovation and efficiency to increase, instead they suggest that it is possible to find a mechanism to build up teams with diversity and reach to the optimum outcome.
For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Women are nearly eight times more likely to lead research projects in biotech firms with flat job-ladders than in more hierarchical academic and pharmaceutical settings.</p>

<p>They are focused on the issue of <em>gender homophily in citations</em> which is mentioned in other articles, that male authors tend to cite male authors more rather than female authors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Multiple studies report that male scholars cite publications of male authors more often than their female colleagues do — and vice versa. This gender homophily in citations points to a fragmentation of science along gender boundaries. However, it is not yet clear whether it is actually (perceived) gender characteristics or structural conditions related to gender that are causing the heightened citation frequency of same-sex authors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since scientists tend to cite people working in their own research area, then differences among male and female scholars and their focus in different research areas plays a role in this citation homophily behavior. And gender homophily in citations is partly due to topical boundaries.</p>
<p>Interesting to note is that in some of these studies the issue is analyzed from a feminist point of view, that males are discriminating against females in a conscious way, and they often provide prescriptive suggestions on how policy makers or activists in science should take action to limit this kind of bias. There are other studies that takes experimental approach and in practice investigates whether there is a bias in evaluating research work of female and male authors. They found that even females were evaluating other female authors’ works lower. They conclude that the bias can be <em>unconscious</em>.</p>
<p>There is studies about human capital stating that the structural forces at work have lead females, from educational point of view, to opt-in for more qualitative specialties and have a different image of themselves. Later, they tend to work in more qualitative fields and subjects which are less central to fields of science and less effective. This causes their works to be valued less and noted less rather than their male counterparts.</p>

<p>This is one of the pioneering studies on the gender differences in research productivity. They were first to call it <em>research productivity puzzle</em>. It is a qualitative study based on interviews with male and female scientists. Both elite scientists and rank and file (normal scientists) are studied.

They tried to explain increases or decreases in the productivity using these life events and academics’ own interpretations.</p>
<p>They claim that females publish less than males, but marriage and motherhood is not the cause. Since they controlled for it and married females with children are publishing equal to their single female counterparts and both of these groups are significantly publishing less than males.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Surprisingly, in comparison to other, they saw that patterns of collaboration is similar between males and females.

<p>It is different from their other article <span class="citation">(Cole and Zuckerman <a href="#ref-cole1987marriage">1987</a>)</span>. This is more bibliometric and quantitative analysis of publication histories. They have carefully build up a sample of 526 male and female scientists who received doctorates in 1969-1970 with matched profiles (based on department and time of graduation).</p>
<p>They found that if impact, in terms of number of citation, is compared in a paper by paper basis, females are cited as often or slightly more often than males, but because females publish less, their work has less impact in the aggregate level.
They have examined three explanations for gender differences in productivity:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no support for the view that women publish less because they collaborate less often than men, when collaboration is measured by extent of multiple authorship. Nor are overall gender differences in citation attributable to gender differences in first authorship, Women are first authors as often as men. Last, there is support for a hypothesis attributing differentials in productivity to differential reinforcement. Women are not only less often reinforced than men, reinforcement being crudely indicated by citations, but they respond to it differently. Women were less apt to maintain or increase their output and more apt to reduce it than comparably cited men at the same levels of prior productivity. Reinforcement has less effect on later output of women than of men. Although gender differences in output and impact are statistically significant, their substantive importance is not self-evident. It is not clear whether observed gender differences signal real disparities in contribution to science. Nor is it clear how productivity should be measured over the course of scientific careers. Questions are also raised about the nature of age, period, and cohort effects at the institutional and societal levels.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>They discuss the two main explanations put forward by literature that possibly females <em>choose</em> to leave academia which is not a welcoming environment for them, or they are being <em>forced</em> out of academia due to their lack of human capital in terms of publications standards and impact measurements which is termed as <em>leaky pipeline</em> for them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>our paper focuses on those women who wish to remain in academia, regardless of how friendly or unfriendly the institutional climate, but do not make it past the assistant professor rank.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They present vast descriptive results of background and demographic information on scientists:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our 2009 survey of the members of the International Studies Association (ISA) and subsequent analysis addresses this issue in two ways. First, we wanted to see if women are in fact producing at lower rates than men in international studies, as the literature finds happens in many disciplines. Second, we wanted to understand what factors affect publication rates during the assistant professor years. We focused on the assistant professor years because if women do not publish enough early in their careers, they are presumably far less likely to have long-term academic careers. Our findings suggest a variety of ways in which universities might change their policies to better aid assistant professors in achieving research records that will earn them tenure, and in which individual scholars might think strategically about their research and publications.</p>

<p>“Aligned with these investigations of personality structure are studies which focus upon the biographical background of scientists. These biographical studies have probed a wide range of items including early childhood experiences, sources of derived satisfactions and dissatisfactions, descriptions of parents, attitudes and interests, value preferences, self-descriptions and evaluations. The aim is to determine the biographical characteristics, experiences, and self-descriptions which differentiate the highly productive and creative, from the less productive and creative, scientist. From these studies, one set of biographical attributes emerges strongly and consistently: eminent and productive scientists show marked autonomy, independence, and self-sufficiency early in their lives. This autonomy is apparent in early preferences for teachers who let them alone, in attitudes toward religion, and in dispositions toward personal relations. In their personal relations, specifically, the creative and productive scientists tend to be detached from their immediate families, isolated from social relations, and attached, instead, to the inanimate objects and abstract ideas of their work. These scientists emerge as ‘dominant persons who are not overly concerned with other persons’ lives or with attaining approval for the work [they are] doing’.” (p 287)</p>

Here he mentions that sociology is an <em>interstitial discipline</em> (based on <span class="citation">Abbott (<a href="#ref-abbott2001chaos">2001</a>)</span>), meaning that sociology is working on subjects that are borrowed from other fields or there are overlaps with other fields, so it can be considered as a field in the space between other fields which does not have clear borders with them while those fields have clear separations in their idea spaces.</p>
<p><strong><span class="citation">Moody (<a href="#ref-moody2004structure">2004</a>)</span> </strong></p>
<p>He compares three competeing theories in an effort to explain the structure of collaboation networks in sociology (from ASR and Sociological abstracts).
These include 1) A highly clustered network similar to small world phenomenon which is the description based on highly divided picture of sociology that has theories without an overarching theory and composed of multiple disconnected research specialties, 2) A structure mainly concentrated around star scientists with preferential attachement mechanism at work, and 3) A structurally cohesive network.</p>
<p>He starts with the idea of _structural cohesion from Durkheim and others which can generate coherent idea systems.
He reviews literature on how sociologcial community and collaboration structure looks like, the first assumption is the high divide between different sub-groups of sociology with different theoretical and empirical specialties, which signals a communitiy with clear cut clusters which are connected to each other only by few links and this structure is closest to a small world.
Second view is the star production which implies some leaders with high number of publications and citations who are leading the idea space. The structure of network follows a preferential attachement and new members who join the collaboration network work with those who have already a high prestige and status in the network. The third hypothesis is a strucuturally cohesive network in which there is not clear fissures or breaks between different parts of the network which implies that authors of different idea spaces and theories need to refer to each others’ work and those members of the community with high specialty in methodologies and techniques can acquire key positions and status among different sub-sets of the community.</p>

<p>Furthermore, normative tension can occur between the multifaceted priorities of individual scientists (i.e., high publication and citation scores, big grants, consideration and peer esteem) and the real priority of the scientific community, i.e., scientific knowledge development.

<p>National research assessment efforts, and how policies like ANVUR in Italy want to evaluate research productivity versus bibliometric assessments and comparing these two methods of evaluation in terms of costs, pros and cons.</p>
<p>They mention six evaluation criteria, briefly:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accuracy</strong>; The degree of closeness of performance indicators measurements to their true value</li>
<li><strong>Robustness</strong>; The ability of the system to provide a ranking which is not sensitive to the share of the research product evaluated</li>
<li><strong>Validity</strong>; The ability of the system to measure what counts</li>
<li><strong>Functionality</strong>; The ability of the measurement system to serve all the functions it is used for</li>
<li><strong>Time</strong>; The time needed to carry out the measurement</li>
<li><strong>Costs</strong>; The direct and indirect costs of measuring</li>
</ul>
<p>At the end they conclude that considering cost and time effectiveness of bibliometric evaluations, they can be at least adopted for formal and natural sciences, and for other disciplines like humanities and social sciences, peer review could be the preferable choices.</p>

And this is one of the first works that mentions the tensions in Italian academia after the idea of research evaluation is mentioned. Like the ambiguities in law and decrees. They discuss the role MIUR should play in Italian academic evaluation and pros and cons of having external or internal (or both at the same time) evaluators.</p>

<p><strong><span class="citation">Bertocchi et al. (<a href="#ref-bertocchi2015bibliometric">2015</a>)</span> </strong></p>
<p>They have chosen 590 random papers among 5681 which have been reviewed by ANVUR in VQR 2004-2010.
They have compared bibliometric and peer review evaluation of these papers.
They have found close and significant agreement between the two methods of evaluation.</p>
<p>They have been focused only on some fields from VQR 2004-2010:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this paper, we draw on the experience of the panel that evaluated Italian research in Economics, Management and Statistics during the national assessment exercise (VQR) relative to the period 2004–2010.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They clearly mention the difference between blind peer review (the normal peer review) and the “informed peer review” that ANVUR and VQR have applied in their evaluation, which means, refrees are aware of the identity of the authors and where the papers have been already published. This causes some biases in the evaluation and in their results to compare peer review with bibliometric statistics.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In other words, we cannot disentangle whether the correlation that we observe depends on an intrinsic relation or on the influence of the information on publication outlets on the reviewers.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As a consequence of this caveat, we need to be clear about the policy implications that we can draw from our analysis. Particularly, as noted, we cannot make any claim about the validity of bibliometrics as a substitute for peer review, let alone advocating the substitution of the informed peer review process with bibliometric assessments.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The goal of the VQR exercise is to evaluate published work of Italian academics between 2004 and 2010, and therefore this limitation is imposed on us by the very structure and goals of the VQR exercise. Future VQR waves could compare bibliometric analysis and peer review using anonymized published material so that neither the publication outlet nor the name of the authors are revealed to the reviewers.</p>

(<a href="#ref-Benedetto2017CommentsOT">2017</a><a href="#ref-Benedetto2017CommentsOT">a</a>)</span>))</p>
<p>They mention three main critical methodological vulnerabilities of the VQR 2011–2014, partly inherited from the VQR 2004–2010, are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Small sample of papers evaluated for each researcher</li>
<li>Incorrect and anachronistic use of journal metrics for assessing individual papers</li>
<li>misleading normalization and composition of Ci and Ji</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>We are doubtful whether the whole procedure – once completed thanks to the participation of tens of thousands of individuals, including evaluation experts, researchers, administrative staff, government agencies, etc. – will lead to the desired results, i.e., providing reliable information to rank universities and other research institutions, depending on the quality of their research. We understand the importance of national research assessment exercises for guiding strategic decisions, however, we believe that the VQR 2011–2014 has too many vulnerabilities that make it unsound and often controversial.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Solutions they suggest:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Major vulnerabilities of the VQR 2011–2014 can be (at least partly) solved by (1) extending the bibliometric evaluation procedure to the totality of the papers, (2) avoiding the use of journal metrics in general, and (3) avoiding questionable normalizations/combinations of the indicators in use. Finally, the introduction of the so-called altmetrics could be a way to solve (at least partly) the old problem of estimating the impact of relatively recent articles, without (mis)using journal metrics.</p>

<p>They answer the criticisms on <em>small sample of research work evaluated</em>, by saying that asking for all the papers published in the period under study is against the <em>principle of treating all areas equally</em>, and it has never been adopted by RAEs or REF in UK.</p>
<p>To answer <em>use of journal’s impact as a bibliometric indicator</em> they pose three reasons, large number of community under evaluation, recentness of the publications, and use of two bibliometric indicators instead of one.</p>
<p>And for other points on <em>normalization and combination of bibliometric indicators</em> they cite a response on “La Voce” website that they have given recently and they point out that authors didn’t give alternative proposals for the criticisms they raise, i.e., their criticisms are not constructive.</p>

<p>They claim that ANVUR staff did not have the necessary knowledge for the evaluation and they were not ready to receive and accept constructive suggestions.

<p>This is answer of the ANVUR members to <span class="citation">Abramo and D’Angelo (<a href="#ref-abramo2017tit">2017</a>)</span>. They start by stating that Abramo and D’Angelo’s idea of a “Scientometric model of evaluation” that can be applied in different fields of science is a simplistic one and the case of national scale research assessment is more complex and multi-faceted. ANVUR has to evaluate not just research, but also teaching, administrative performance, social impact, student competence etc. which includes hard sciences to humanities and social sciences.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Italian legislator’s choice not to entrust it to scientometricians, but rather to leading scientists and scholars, competent in different fields and highly familiar with the higher education system in a plurality of countries, has been indeed a wise one. And the fact that Abramo and D’Angelo are not even capable to imagine the scope of such an evaluation, even if one remains within the boundaries of “research” (itself a rather differentiated system, which requires the intimate knowledge of scientists and scholars), is highly indicative of the limited horizons within which they move.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Abramo and D’Angelo continue by asking the rhetorical question “Why did ANVUR then not enforce the ‘equality’ principle in this case, rather than offering bibliometrics for some and not others?”. Even in this case, the answer is very simple: there are scientific areas, such as social sciences, law, humanities, where bibliometrics indicators are totally unreliable.</p>

<p>He discusses the macro level policies which might affect how science and scientific discoveries work, he mentions examples from countries with centralized control, e.g., a ministry, on top of higher education system and academia compared to countries without this type of central agency, such as USA, which tend to show different approaches in solving problems and making scientific discoveries.</p>
<p><strong><span class="citation">Baccini and De Nicolao (<a href="#ref-baccini2016they">2016</a>)</span> </strong></p>
<p>This is another paper which discusses the experiment ANVUR did (mentioned in <span class="citation">Bertocchi et al. (<a href="#ref-bertocchi2015bibliometric">2015</a>)</span>) to check for the aggreement between <em>informed peer review</em> and <em>bibliometric analysis</em> of the publications and individual scientists’ productiviy or quality of publications. With this meta-analysis they find out that the results and acceptable and good levels of agreement that ANVUR reported was <em>not</em> right <em>if you consider how to interpret Kappa scores used in the experiment</em>, and they find only one exception of Area 13 which there could be a fair amount of aggreement between the two method of evaluation.</p>
<p>They conclude that agencies should not substitute informed peer review and bibliometric evaluation results, since there is differences between the two and the Italian national assessment case is even more error prone, because they have mixed the two evaluation methods and it has made it impossible to disentangle the causes to say if a higher evaluation means a field had performed better science or it was due to higher percentage of bibliometric evaluation of papers (since based on ANVUR results, bibliometric evaluation was giving higher ranks to papers than informed peer review).</p>

They also point to the hardships of development, implementation and acceptance of a performance-based research funding, discussing the case of UK.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>European university funding systems have experienced significant changes in the last 30 years. In all countries, non-government funding sources and performance-based competitive allocation systems have increased. The UK and the Italian models would seem to represent two extremes cases; the UK is a more competitive system involving more private funding (about 50% of total university funding), while Italy depends mostly on public funding (about 75% of total university funding) and especially on the central government bulk grant.</p>

<p>Authors did in-depth qualitative interviews with academics from a university in Australia that has undergone major reforms in 2007 (e.g., adopting performance based research evaluation system) that has lead to exit of a share of their senior academics. This has been replaced with early career employees. They have focused on how academics react to this increasing <em>managerialism</em> in academia and they have found out that resistance and protest is not that much prevailing among academics. They have used metaphor of game which allows them to consider academics as participants of a game in which they are more and more embedded and they continue to <em>legitimize</em> the game by continuing to play by its rules.</p>
<p><strong><span class="citation">Blume (<a href="#ref-blume1987social">1987</a>)</span> </strong></p>
<p>This is a collection of articles published as a book and edited by known scientists in scientomertics and sociology of science. It is focused on the idea of how external players and factors can affect and shape production of science. This effect can stem from these external figures being involved in <em>cooperation</em> with scientists, or in case of constraining <em>priorities of what should be studied by science</em> by means of them providing financial support to scientists (i.e., influencing them in priorities).</p>
<p>They cover different aspects of the subject, in reviewing the theoretical positions (e.g., p 3) they mention the distinction that <em>marxist theoretician</em> put between <em>science</em> (“direct knowledge” which “does not contain anything that indicates its social origin”) and <em>research</em> (“tied to social conditions and relations of production”).</p>
<p>In another part (e.g., p 277), they focus on the topic of cooperation between social scientists and political actors and “<em>The Policy-Oriented Social Sciences: The Rush to Relevance</em>” which points to efforts by sociologists after world war II to provide answers to social issues in three cases of Italy, France and Germany, while this did not actually happen, at least not until 1960s. He discusses the different paths social sciences took in each of these countries due to relatively different relationship between scientists and political actors and the level of consolidation and instituionalization the scientific fields had experienced in each of those coutexts.</p>
<p>They frame the idea behind the book and collection of articles (e.g., p 331) as an effort to comparatively study:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The”bottom up" initiatives of scientists who wanted their research to be more socially relevant and hence had sought collaboration with non-scientific groups"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They mention (p 345):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The traditional picture of internal cognitive criteria versus external non-cognitive criteria fades away, and a two-dimensionality of all the problems related to the science system emerges: between, on the one hand, the social actors intervening in the scientific enterprise, forming coalitions, inter-organizational structures, and arrangements, and the scientists stepping into these relations to mobilize resources or from more idealistic motives; while on the other hand, the substance of the demand is a cognitive reflection of what we might call the proto-scientific mode of a social problem.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When the scientists are “over-powered” in such relations, they ought to resist; when they succumb in such a situation, for example because of resource dependency, they may be distracted from the cognitive goals of their fields, and in the long term their knowledge may be reduced to obsolete expertise.</p>

<p>He starts from work of <em>Mary Henkel</em> and tries to provide the basis of how a sociology of academic work should look like.
He provides comparisons and similarities and differences among the studies of academic work which can be similar to dichotomies, like being mertonian, or versus strong programme.
He emphasizes that transformation of higher education institutions into managed organizations leads to some questions like: question of situation, condition of work, ways of producing and diffusing knowledge, norms and identities of the academic profession.</p>
<p><strong><span class="citation">Abbott (<a href="#ref-abbott2000reflections">2000</a>)</span> </strong></p>
<p>In this paper Abbott talks about the probable future of sociology as a field, if it will survive or not:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I realize that there are sociologists in commercial or governmental contexts, but in the United States sociology is dominated by an academic labor market and the training institutions that support that labor market.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He argues that sociology is not as coherently centered around a method, as anthropology is around ethnography. Or it is not as coherently centered around a theory as economics is around choice theory or centered around a topic as political science is around power.</p>
