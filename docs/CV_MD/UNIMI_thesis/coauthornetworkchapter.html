<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Examining coauthorship networks is key to study scientist collaboration patterns and structural characteristics of scientific communities. This requires temporal and multi-level quantitative analysis. Here, we focus on coauthorship networks of sociologists in Italy, which were under-studied so far. By looking at publications indexed in Scopus, we detect the <em>largest</em> and <em>most stable</em> research communities in Italian sociology. We found that Italian sociologists are fractured in many disconnected groups, but two prominent communities are formed by <em>economic</em> and <em>political sociologists</em> around certain research topics. By applying an exponential random graph model, we found that collaboration ties were mainly driven by the <em>research focus</em>. However, other factors, such as <em>preferential attachment</em>, gender and affiliation homophily were also important. Our findings show that <em>political sociologists</em> tend to be more international. Our research shows the advantages of multi-level and temporal network analysis in revealing the complexity of scientific collaboration patterns.</p>

In addition, collaboration is also key to recognition and academic reputation <span class="citation">(Merton <a href="#ref-merton1968matthew">1968</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Quantitative analysis of coauthorship ties from scientific publications has been one of the most important means to study scientific collaboration <span class="citation">(Katz and Martin <a href="#ref-km97">1997</a>; Batagelj, Ferligoj, and Squazzoni <a href="#ref-batagelj2017emergence">2017</a>)</span>. This type of study reveals conditions and effects of collaboration across a wide spectrum of scientific activities, ranging from grant proposal to funding <span class="citation">(Sciabolazza et al. <a href="#ref-sciabolazza2017detecting">2017</a>; Bellotti, Kronegger, and Guadalupi <a href="#ref-bellotti_evolution_2016">2016</a>)</span>. Studying coauthorship networks can also reveal the structure of scientific community, the evolution of its epistemic field, the degree of cohesiveness or fragmentation and the co-existence of competing paradigms and communities.</p>
<p>In an influential article <span class="citation">Moody (<a href="#ref-moody2004structure">2004</a>)</span> questioned whether sociology became more socially integrated in the last decades. He examined coauthorship networks of sociologists using all sociological abstracts in English language from 1963 to 1999, amounting to 197,976 abstracts. He evaluated three competing hypotheses on the nature of scientific collaborations in sociology: 1) Collaboration represents a small world of distant communities of sociologists focusing on their substantive research areas, while scholars are connected through short paths; 2) A large periphery of scholars gathered around a core of a few star scientists; or 3) A structurally cohesive network, based on <span class="citation">Abbott (<a href="#ref-abbott2001chaos">2001</a>)</span>, with wide-ranging collaboration between different specialists. He argued that the peculiar position of sociology, which has always been surrounded by adjacent disciplines and idea spaces, could make it permeable to external theories, methods and concepts, making <em>wide-ranging</em> collaborations especially around quantitative research probable.</p>
<p><span class="citation">Moody (<a href="#ref-moody2004structure">2004</a>)</span> found that sociology was characterized by a structurally cohesive core, which has grown steadily over the time. Collaboration depended on research specialization with quantitative researchers engaging more in collaboration. Finally, Moody suggested that a scientist’s probability of being embedded in the core network depended more on collaboration trajectories than on his or her specialty.</p>
<p><span class="citation">Sciabolazza et al. (<a href="#ref-sciabolazza2017detecting">2017</a>)</span> used a modularity algorithm <span class="citation">(Newman and Girvan <a href="#ref-newman2004finding">2004</a>)</span> to examine coauthorship networks between scholars at the University of Florida in 2013-2015. They used an exponential random graph model (ERGM) and found that similar institutional affiliation, spatial proximity, transitivity effects, and use of similar research services provided by the university predicted higher collaboration.</p>
<p><span class="citation">Zhang et al. (<a href="#ref-zhang2018understanding">2018</a>)</span> recently proposed an interesting ERGM specification that is relevant for studying coauthorship networks. They analyzed different factors influencing coauthorship tie formation, including homophily, transitivity and preferential attachment by looking at 633 prolific authors in computer science. Tie formation was found to be a complex process, which is often dominated by transitivity (the tendency of authors to collaborate with their coauthors’ collaborators is strong) and preferential attachment (the more coauthors one has, the more new collaborators (s)he will attract). These factors contribute to the so-called “<em>Matthew effect</em>”, leading to non-linear, cumulative processes of academic recognition and prestige <span class="citation">(Merton <a href="#ref-merton1968matthew">1968</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The case of sociology is interesting. While sociologists collaborate more than humanities scholars and less than physicists <span class="citation">(Babchuk, Keith, and Peters <a href="#ref-babchuk1999collaboration">1999</a>)</span>, they are fragmented in small groups with weak epistemic and methodological coherence and with a contested subject (<span class="citation">Abbott (<a href="#ref-abbott2000reflections">2000</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">Abbott (<a href="#ref-abbott2001chaos">2001</a>)</span>; <span class="citation">Turner (<a href="#ref-turner2006american">2006</a>)</span>). The lack of prominent and paradigmatic figures in the field (<span class="citation">Wallerstein (<a href="#ref-wallerstein2000should">2000</a>)</span>; <span class="citation">Hargens (<a href="#ref-hargens2004mertonian">2004</a>)</span>) and the competition with other specialists, such as economists and political scientists <span class="citation">(Wallerstein <a href="#ref-wallerstein2000should">2000</a>)</span>, could lead to complex collaboration patterns. Furthermore, the case of Italian sociologists is of special interest, considering the limited size of the community and its fracture between more internationalized and more local scholars <span class="citation">(Akbaritabar, Casnici, and Squazzoni <a href="#ref-akbaritabar2018conundrum">2018</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>We first construct the coauthorship network based on publications indexed in Scopus with a “<em>complete</em>” or “<em>sociocentric</em>” <span class="citation">(Marsden <a href="#ref-marsden2002egocentric">2002</a>)</span> network approach. Uncovering patterns in these coauthorship networks requires advanced quantitative analysis. Here, we followed <span class="citation">Sciabolazza et al. (<a href="#ref-sciabolazza2017detecting">2017</a>)</span> to detect research communities and <span class="citation">Zhang et al. (<a href="#ref-zhang2018understanding">2018</a>)</span> in using an ERGM <span class="citation">(Lusher, Koskinen, and Robins <a href="#ref-lusher2013exponential">2013</a>)</span>. We build on previous research on Italian sociologists <span class="citation">Akbaritabar, Casnici, and Squazzoni (<a href="#ref-akbaritabar2018conundrum">2018</a>)</span>; <span class="citation">Bellotti, Kronegger, and Guadalupi (<a href="#ref-bellotti_evolution_2016">2016</a>)</span>), and use a multi-level approach <span class="citation">(Lazega et al. <a href="#ref-lazega2008catching">2008</a>)</span>. We used a sophisticated model to check interaction between different factors in our findings and that allows us to control for individual scientist attributes, along with covariate attributes, communities and network level characteristics.</p>
<p>With this multi-level design, we analyze whether Italian sociologists tended to collaborate preferably with well-known and more prolific colleagues (preferential attachment), with colleagues of their same gender (gender homophily), and with their same affiliation country (affiliation homophily). Furthermore, we analyzed whether they were inclined to collaborate more preferably with colleagues with the same research productivity level and working on the same substantive focus.</p>
<p>The structure of the chapter is as follows: In Section <a href="coauthornetworkchapter.html#datanetworks">2</a>, we present our data and methods. In Section <a href="coauthornetworkchapter.html#resultsnetworks">3</a> we present our findings, while we discuss our main results in Section <a href="coauthornetworkchapter.html#conclusionsnetworks">4</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="datanetworks" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.2</span> Data &amp; Method</h2>
<p>We gathered data from the website of the Italian Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR) for all currently hired sociologists in Italian universities and research centers. This included information about the subject’s current academic position (i.e., assistant, associate or full professor), the “scientific disciplinary sector”<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> in which s/he has been formally assigned (e.g., political sociology, economic sociology etc.), gender, affiliation, department, and last and first name <span class="citation">(Akbaritabar, Casnici, and Squazzoni <a href="#ref-akbaritabar2018conundrum">2018</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>We then extracted all publications by Italian sociologists (3,168 papers) from Scopus in September 2016<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a>. Data included articles’ title, keywords, abstract, publication year, authors’ names and affiliations, and number of citations received. Figure <a href="coauthornetworkchapter.html#fig:range-of-publications-in-all-journals-networks">6.1</a> shows the growth in number of publications in all journals over time.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>For authors whose gender was missing from the website, we searched for an online profile and photo. After careful checking, only 15 cases with missing gender remained. We also aggregated each author’s country of affiliation at the continental level.</p>
<p>We constructed a coauthorship network from articles as undirected ties with equal weights for any coauthorships, even those repeated later in the data <span class="citation">(Newman <a href="#ref-newman2001scientific">2001</a><a href="#ref-newman2001scientific">a</a>, <a href="#ref-newman2001structure">2001</a><a href="#ref-newman2001structure">b</a>)</span>. This is the projection of the bipartite network of the ties between authors and papers. We used Scopus’s author identification numbers<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> to treat name disambiguation <span class="citation">(De Stefano et al. <a href="#ref-de2013use">2013</a>)</span>. We looked at all publications of sociologists in the list, extracted from MIUR website. We collected their collaborations with scientists outside Italy or in other fields of science. However, we did not collect the full publication list for each of their collaborators. This implies that these collaborators existed in the coauthorship network only because they coauthored an article (or more) with an Italian sociologist.</p>
<div id="temporal-community-detection" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.2.1</span> Temporal Community Detection</h3>
<p>In order to detect coauthor communities, we used a temporal community detection <span class="citation">(Mucha et al. <a href="#ref-mucha2010community">2010</a>)</span> as implemented in the <a href="https://github.com/vtraag/louvain-igraph"><code>louvain-igraph</code></a> <span class="citation">(Traag <a href="#ref-louvainigraph2015">2015</a>)</span> library in <code>Python</code> (see <a href="http://louvain-igraph.readthedocs.io/en/latest/multiplex.html#temporal-community-detection">here</a> for <em>how-to-use</em> and technical descriptions). This library allows to apply different community detection methods on network graphs as elaborated in <span class="citation">Traag (<a href="#ref-traag2014algorithms">2014</a>)</span>. We specifically used <em>Constant Potts model</em> (CPM) <span class="citation">(Traag, Van Dooren, and Nesterov <a href="#ref-traag2011narrow">2011</a>)</span>, which is a specific version of the more general Potts model suggested by <span class="citation">Reichardt and Bornholdt (<a href="#ref-reichardt2004detecting">2004</a>)</span>. CPM was proposed by <span class="citation">Traag, Van Dooren, and Nesterov (<a href="#ref-traag2011narrow">2011</a>)</span> as a <em>resolution-limit-free</em> method to overcome the resolution limit in modularity <span class="citation">(Newman and Girvan <a href="#ref-newman2004finding">2004</a>)</span> and other methods for community detection. This limit impedes the detection of small communities in large networks and affects the efficiency of the community detection. The idea of community detection principally emphasizes the importance of links “<em>within</em>” communities rather than those “<em>between</em>” them. CPM introduces a <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> parameter, i.e. the “<em>constant</em>” in the name, leading to communities such that the link density between the communities (external density) is lower than <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> and the link density within communities (internal density) is higher than <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> <span class="citation">(Traag, Van Dooren, and Nesterov <a href="#ref-traag2011narrow">2011</a>)</span>. Note that <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> is the <em>resolution parameter</em> helping CPM to be a <em>resolution-limit-free</em> method. This allows us to detect communities with a particular density and size through the time using the parameters described in Table <a href="coauthornetworkchapter.html#tab:table-of-how-resolution-parameter-interslice-weight-works">6.1</a>.</p>
<p>We divided the cross-sectional graph of all coauthorship ties by each year between 1973 and 2017, for a total of 44 yearly graphs. Each author was included in the yearly co-authorship networks from the year of the first until the year of the last personal publication. This means that authors can appear in a the community even though they had not published in that specific year. This allowed us to consider all active authors and prevents someone being intermittently included and excluded from the network due to lack of publications in a specific year. Each node representing an author in year <em>t</em> was connected to itself with an inter-slice tie. Finally, the whole graph was is the aggregation of all these intra-slice ties (i.e., coauthorships occurring in any particular year) and inter-slice ties (i.e., ties connecting the same author across years). We then applied temporal community detection to this full graph <span class="citation">(Mucha et al. <a href="#ref-mucha2010community">2010</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Table <a href="coauthornetworkchapter.html#tab:table-of-how-resolution-parameter-interslice-weight-works">6.1</a> presents the two main parameters affecting the temporal community detection, the resolution parameter and the inter-slice weight. Varying these parameters allowed us to detect communities of different size and different stability over time. After checking, we set the resolution (i.e., <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>, the density of communities in CPM) to <span class="math inline">\(2 \times 10^{-2}\)</span> and inter-slice weight to <code>1</code>. Note that the inter-slice weight controls the level of dynamics between the communities, i.e., how much authors’ movement is allowed. This means that authors could leave a community and join another one in this 44 years period. This particular configuration gave us the two <em>largest</em> and <em>most stable</em> communities in the giant component over time.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.2.2</span> Visualization techniques: Alluvial plots and substantive focus with term maps</h3>
<p>Alluvial plots are one of the most expressive visualization methods to represent change in large temporal networks <span class="citation">(Rosvall and Bergstrom <a href="#ref-rosvall2010">2010</a>)</span>. It uses ribbons over a bar plot of time (e.g., years) to represent the flow of information, nodes, resources and the like among different groups over time. Here, we presented communities as blocks of authors with different colors. The height of each block shows the size of the community. Whenever authors change their membership and join another coauthorship community, their color changes in the plot and they join another block which is presented with mergers and splits in the ribbons linking blocks at different years. Vice versa, following an author’s individual ribbon shows their inter-community movement. This allowed us to see the flow of authors among coauthorship communities. <em>Ribbons</em> connecting to the author in each year from previous years (being still present in the stacked bar) which does not follow into subsequent years would indicate inactivity in publication, i.e. due to retirement from academia, or publications in sources which are not indexed in Scopus.</p>
<p>In order to study the substantive focus of publications, we used VOSviewer, a software tool developed by <span class="citation">Van Eck and Waltman (<a href="#ref-van2010software">2010</a>)</span>. This allowed us to parse corpora of text, detect terms, i.e., <em>noun-phrases</em>, using natural language processing and obtain a term map visualization based on the VOS layout algorithm <span class="citation">(Eck et al. <a href="#ref-van2010comparison">2010</a>)</span>. The distance between terms in this map reflects co-occurrence of such terms in documents: more frequently co-occurring terms tend to appear close to each other. Additionally, this tool clusters terms together. In our case, we also considered author level characteristics (e.g., coauthorship communities’ membership, country of affiliation, first and last publication dates as proxy of academic career trajectories) to understand substantive focus of research. For example, we overlaid the coauthorship communities found by the temporal community detection method on top of the substantive term maps to see if they corresponded to research specialization.</p>
</div>
<div id="exponential-random-graph-model" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.2.3</span> Exponential Random Graph Model</h3>
<p>Finally, we used Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs) to simulate networks based on the giant component of Italian sociologists and their coauthors network, i.e. our observed network <span class="citation">(Lusher, Koskinen, and Robins <a href="#ref-lusher2013exponential">2013</a>)</span>. This provided a baseline to estimate if our coauthorship network was reflecting unique characteristics compared to what we would expect from a distribution of random networks.</p>
<p>Furthermore, ERGMs allowed us to consider different types of attributes while modelling the probability of tie existence in the network. <em>Node</em> attributes included certain authors properties such as academic seniority, gender and continental region of affiliation. <em>Covariate</em> attributes allowed us to control and compare two nodes on the two ends of an edge for similarity or differences of attributes. This allowed us to control for homophily effects in our network (e.g., <span class="citation">Bianchi, Casnici, and Squazzoni (<a href="#ref-bianchi2018solidarity">2018</a>)</span>). Furthermore, ERGMs enabled us to check <em>structural effects</em> such as preferential attachment (by degree distribution), thereby considering possible Matthew effects <span class="citation">(Merton <a href="#ref-merton1968matthew">1968</a>)</span>, i.e., cumulative advantage in collaborations. This mix of nodal and structural attributes in one integrated model was of paramount importance to map tie existence more effectively.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.3</span> Results</h2>
<p>Figure <a href="coauthornetworkchapter.html#fig:full-network-visualization">6.2</a> shows the coauthorship network of all Italian sociologists and their coauthors with affiliation of authors indicated by node colors. Ties are colored based on being <em>within</em> or <em>between</em> the affiliation groups. we found that Italian sociologists (1,641 out of 2,747 total) are mostly connected by intermediation of coauthors affiliated elsewhere (see gray nodes on Figure <a href="coauthornetworkchapter.html#fig:full-network-visualization">6.2</a>; see below for detail on this). Table <a href="coauthornetworkchapter.html#tab:descriptive-figures-on-all-italian-sociologists-coauthorship-network">6.2</a> shows the main features of this network. The sparse coauthorship relations (Average degree = 5.5) with relatively high number of connected components (512) indicate the level of disconnectedness of the network. The connected components greatly vary in size: the largest connected component had 712 members, while the second largest component had 184 members (Mean = 5.37, SD = 32.72). The large number of small connected components indicate there are quite some authors who published either alone, or with few coauthors, in isolation from the rest of the authors.</p>
<p>As indicated in Table <a href="coauthornetworkchapter.html#tab:descriptive-figures-on-all-italian-sociologists-coauthorship-network">6.2</a> (Rows indicated by <em>(G-comp)</em>), the giant component only contains 26% of the nodes in the full network, with 29% of the ties. This is a relatively low percentage compared to random networks simulated with similar degree distribution as observed one (i.e. scale-free, preferential attachemnt and random networks). The average degree of the giant component was relatively low (6.24, SD = 6.61), and only slightly higher than the average degree of the full network (5.55, SD = 6.74).</p>

<p>Figure <a href="coauthornetworkchapter.html#fig:full-coauthorship-evolution-leavers-stayers">6.3</a> provides a different visualization of the coauthorship network and shows the temporal evolution of the authors. Following <span class="citation">Palla, Barabási, and Vicsek (<a href="#ref-palla2007quantifying">2007</a>)</span>, who suggested to use this type of visualization to examine the movement of individuals between communities, we distinguished four groups of authors: 1) Those who published at least two years before a given year and continued to publish for at least two years later (<em>old members/staying</em>, see lightest color, bottom stack of bars in plot), 2) Those who published at least two years before a given year with the last publication in the given year (<em>old members/leaving</em>, see darker color than first group, second stack of bars from bottom in plot), 3) Those who first published in the given year, and published for at least two more years (<em>new members/staying</em>, darker than the two first groups, third stack of bars from bottom in plot), and 4) Those who first published in the given year and did not publish from then (<em>new members/leaving</em>, darkest colors, fourth stack of bars on plot).</p>
<p>Note that most authors in the sample were <em>newcomers</em> who immediately left and disappeared from Scopus the following year (darkest stack of bars in Fig <a href="coauthornetworkchapter.html#fig:full-coauthorship-evolution-leavers-stayers">6.3</a>). However, some newcomers joined the core of more senior authors of the sample (second stack of bars from the top).</p>

<p>Table <a href="coauthornetworkchapter.html#tab:descriptive-table-cluster-attributes">6.3</a> shows the share of these two communities considering author attributes (i.e. gender and country of affiliation). It is worth noting that we did not find any significant gender differences in the two communities, at least in terms of overall share of members (see the plot on the right panel of Figure <a href="coauthornetworkchapter.html#fig:combine-2-images-of-clusters-from-temporal-community-detection">6.6</a>). However, as described above, we found gender differences in the share of <em>newcomers leaving</em> and <em>old members staying</em> (For a gender based comparison, see Figure <a href="coauthornetworkchapter.html#fig:giant-component-coauthorship-evolution-leavers-stayers-with-genders">6.11</a> in the <a href="coauthornetworkchapter.html#appendixnetworks">Appendix</a>). Regarding the country of affiliation, we found that community 0 was composed of sociologists working in <em>Italy</em> while community 1 had a higher share of <em>international</em> authors, from either <em>Europe</em> or <em>other</em> countries.</p>

<p>Table <a href="coauthornetworkchapter.html#tab:descriptive-table-cluster-ties-percentage">6.4</a> shows the percentage of ties <em>within</em> and <em>between</em> the two communities. We found the lowest possible ties among the two communities (0.05% equal to one tie out of 2,221 total) and the highest ties within each community. To understand the possible underlying mechanisms of community membership in more detail, we considered other author attributes.</p>
<p>Table <a href="coauthornetworkchapter.html#tab:descriptive-giant-component-ties-gender-percentages">6.5</a> shows the percentage of ties <em>within</em> and <em>between</em> authors of different gender. The highest percentage of ties between authors of the giant component (43.18%) were <em>cross-gender collaborations</em>, while 33.72% of all ties formed in the giant component were within <em>male authors</em>. In line with previous findings, <em>female-to-female</em> coauthorship ties were rarer (e.g., <span class="citation">Teele and Thelen (<a href="#ref-teele2017gender">2017</a>)</span>). However, it is worth noting that the total number of females (44.1%) were lower than male authors (53.79%). This means that these findings could be due to the lower number of potential female collaborators to choose among.</p>
<p>Table <a href="coauthornetworkchapter.html#tab:descriptive-giant-component-ties-between-italians-or-others-percentages">6.6</a> shows the percentage of ties <em>within</em> and <em>between</em> two specific groups of authors: 1) Those who were currently hired Italian sociologists and 2) those who could be affiliated either in an Italian institution or abroad, either sociologist or not, either active or retired, but in any case, not included in the administrative list. Note that the highest percentage of ties (46.2%) were <em>within</em> those not currently employed in an Italian institution. Only 25.35% of ties were <em>within</em> Italian sociologists.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.3.1</span> Substantive focus of research</h3>
<p>In order to understand the border between the two communities of the giant component better, we considered the type of research. We developed term maps based on titles, keywords and abstracts of all papers included in the sample. By overlaying the community membership (i.e. communities 0 and 1 of the giant component) on top of the substantive term maps, we tested the hypothesis that membership in communities was based on similarity in research focus between members.</p>
<p>As shown in Figures <a href="coauthornetworkchapter.html#fig:cluster-0-substantive-focus">6.7</a>, <a href="coauthornetworkchapter.html#fig:cluster-1-substantive-focus">6.8</a> and <a href="coauthornetworkchapter.html#fig:non-giant-comp-members-substantive-focus">6.9</a> (see the focus of research of each group on the yellow part of the term map), community 0 mainly consisted of <em>economic sociologists</em> doing research, for instance, on <em>labour market</em>, <em>employment</em>, <em>migration</em>, and <em>inequality</em>, while community 1 mainly consisted of <em>political sociologists</em> studying <em>public opinion</em>, <em>Internet</em>, <em>news</em>, <em>journalist</em>, and <em>elections</em>, to name a few topics. Figure <a href="coauthornetworkchapter.html#fig:non-giant-comp-members-substantive-focus">6.9</a> shows the substantive focus of all other authors who were not a member of the giant component. While their focus was clearly different from communities 0 and 1, they obviously do not overlap because they focus on different topics.</p>

</div>
<p>In order to examine mechanisms that can explain these patterns, we built four ERGMs, including structural and individual factors. Table <a href="#tab:ergmstable"><strong>??</strong></a> shows results of the four ERGMs. Model 1 included only structural effects (i.e. ties and preferential attachment). It shows that there was a strong effect of <em>preferential attachment</em> in coauthorship ties existence. This indicates that authors who were already famous scholars with higher number of collaborations were the ones with higher probability of forming coauthorship ties.</p>
<p>Note, given that the coauthorship network is a one-mode projection of bipartite ties, i.e. <em>paper-author ties</em>, higher rates of cliquish structures can be simply due to articles with high number of authors, as this typically generates a maximal clique. This can determine a high preferential attachment effect. To control for this, we included temporal community detection membership by considering cross-sectional networks of coauthorship yearly. This is expected to reduce the artificial importance of cliquish structures because the communities are detected over all years not a single year. Consider that unlike in the hard sciences, multiple coauthorship ties in the same year are rare among sociologists. Note also that this yearly view on the whole network helped us to reduce the effect caused by bipartite to one-mode projection.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we added other author attributes to see if the preferential attachment effect will hold. Model 2 included only author attributes (e.g., gender, continental region of affiliation, similarity in first and last publication dates which would indicate seniority and experience and the total number of publications). ERGMs model the probabilty of tie existence, since our community detection configuration is rewarding ties <em>within</em> a community than <em>between</em> two communities, therefore naturally membership in those communities would have an endogeneity effect leading to high effect of community membership on tie existense in ERGM. Thus, in Model 2 we have excluded <em>temporal community membership</em> which is added in Model 3. The main effects between the two models stayed the same with Model 3 having better BIC and AIC. We found that being member of one of the two temporal communities (i.e., having substantive research focus similar to <em>economic</em> or <em>political</em> sociologists) had the highest effect in increasing the tie existence probability. Tie existence was also influenced in descendent order of probability by working in <em>other</em> countries (e.g., North America, Australia and New Zealand, South America and Asia), <em>European</em> countries, institutions in <em>Italy</em>, having close or similar date of <em>latest</em> publication (e.g., publishing until recently)<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> , being <em>male</em>, having close or similar date of <em>earliest</em> publication or having <em>different</em> number of <em>total publications</em><a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a>. Being <em>female</em> did not have any significant effect on tie existence.</p>
<p>Finally, Model 4 shows the mix of effects in Models 1, 2 and 3. We found that including author attributes and temporal community detection significantly <em>decreased</em> the structural effect of <em>preferential attachment</em> on tie existence (from a coefficient equal to 15.095 in Model 1 down to 4.063 in Model 3<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a>). Effect of other variables had the same order and quite similar rates as in Model 2 and 3.</p>
<p>To sum up, the results show that <em>having a similar substantive research</em> focus and working in specific countries had an effect on the way Italian sociologists collaborated and their international exposure. Secondly, we found that the general rule of the “<em>rich gets richer</em>” was highly affected by the interplay between these variables. Note that the mixture of node attributes and community level effects model specification in Model 4 was a better fit than Models 1, 2 and 3 (see AIC and BIC measures in the last rows of the table, the smaller, the better).</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.4</span> Conclusions and discussion</h2>
<p>Our study provided an empirical overview of collaboration <em>within</em> and <em>between</em> sociologists in Italy and their collaborators worldwide. We constructed a coauthorship network based on the publications indexed in Scopus and used temporal community detection to detect the two largest and most stable communities of the giant component. Although the communities are gender balanced, male newcomers are more likely to continue in academia than females. The communities differ in their research focus and international exposure. We ran ERGMs to control the effect of certain author attributes (i.e. gender, country of affiliation and scientific career), local structural configurations and community memberships (i.e. substantive focus) on coauthorship tie.</p>
<p>In general, we found that Italian sociology is a collection of isolated islands. The coauthorship pattern was mainly driven by preferential attachment and research focus. When we considered other author attributes, the preferential attachment effect was reduced. Our findings showed that adopting a <em>multi-level</em> approach while considering <em>temporal dimensions</em> in the study of scientific collaboration is key to reveal the interplay between factors of different levels (e.g., individual, community, covariate attributes and network structure levels).</p>
<p>Our results revealed two communities of sociologists that are relatively well connected among each other. First, we found a community of economic sociologists studying <em>labour market</em>, <em>employment</em>, <em>migration</em>, and <em>inequality</em>. The second community included political sociologists studying <em>public opinion</em>, <em>Internet</em>, <em>news</em>, <em>journalist</em>, and <em>elections</em>. These two communities form the giant component of the coauthorship network of sociologists in Italy. We also found many (511) other connected components of authors publishing either alone or with few authors <span class="citation">(Babchuk, Keith, and Peters <a href="#ref-babchuk1999collaboration">1999</a>)</span>. The community of <em>political sociologists</em> is more international than the community of <em>economic sociologists</em>. Both communities have been growing in size in recent years. It seems our results are more in line with first hypothesis of <span class="citation">Moody (<a href="#ref-moody2004structure">2004</a>)</span>’s study (a small world of distant communities) since we found many distant communities and in case of the two main communities in the giant component they had specific research focuses with lowest possible ties with the other community.</p>
<p>Whether these communities are influenced by the <em>scientific disciplinary sectors</em> or by the specific department environments in which scientists are embedded could be subject of further inquiry.</p>
<p>This would also require a more extensive sample coverage. Indeed, despite the fact that Scopus has the highest coverage among bibliographic data sources (especially in Italian language as shown in <span class="citation">Mongeon and Paul-Hus (<a href="#ref-mongeon2016journal">2016</a>)</span>), Italian sociologists publish many articles, book chapters and monographs that are not indexed in Scopus. Previous research showed that only 63.81% of Italian sociologists have at least one publication record indexed in Scopus and it could be due to lower coverage of Italian language or local publication outlets <span class="citation">(Akbaritabar, Casnici, and Squazzoni <a href="#ref-akbaritabar2018conundrum">2018</a>)</span>. This could have limited the completeness of the coauthorship networks. Further research using sources such as Google Scholar, which covers more Italian publishers, could help to complete this type of analysis.</p>
<p>Secondly, our analysis did not provide a robust explanation of the underlying mechanisms that account for these observed patterns. For instance, strategic decisions about collaboration could be constrained by certain factors, such as joint collaboration in research proposals, PhD programs, and scientific associations or academic mobility across institutions, which we did not consider here. Furthermore, collaboration could be inhibited by the institutional separation between different disciplines in Italy, which have a strong influence on grants, hiring and promotions. Finally, coauthorship patterns could also reflect the capacity of certain scientists to build international ties. Not only do international collaborations increase recognition and prestige of the most productive scientists; they in turn tend to stimulate network expansion leading to self-reinforcing processes <span class="citation">(Leydesdorff, Park, and Wagner <a href="#ref-lpw14">2014</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>Figure <a href="coauthornetworkchapter.html#fig:ERGM-goodness-of-fit">6.10</a> presents the goodness of fit analysis for our ERGM model (It is only shown for the most extended one, Model 4 in Table <a href="#tab:ergmstable"><strong>??</strong></a>). It considers the model specification and estimates to what extent our model was able to detect the observed network’s behavior. Considering that in order to control for <em>preferential attachment</em> our attention was on the <em>degree distribution</em>, the first panel in top left side of Figure <a href="coauthornetworkchapter.html#fig:ERGM-goodness-of-fit">6.10</a> indicates that our model predicted considerably well our observed network. However, it must be said that in other goodness of fit measures, which are based on <em>edgewise shared partners</em> (that we didn’t include in the model do to degeneracy issue) on top right, and the minimum geodesic distance (on which normally most ERGMs are not good) left bottom, our model did relatively bad. On the Goodness of fit evaluation based on covarriates (bottom right of Figure <a href="coauthornetworkchapter.html#fig:ERGM-goodness-of-fit">6.10</a>) our model did well.</p>

Data gathering started by sending search queries to Scopus API on July 27<sup>th</sup> 2016, while from September 8<sup>th</sup> 2016 we gathered Scopus CSV exports of all available information on publications through Scopus web interface to cover shortages with data from API.

<li id="fn29"><p>We controlled for IDs duplication or multiplicity by cross-checking Scopus web interface data with information extracted from API (using the R scripts described before).<a href="coauthornetworkchapter.html#fnref29" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn30"><p>In ERGM terms, <em>absdiff</em> is used to check for close or far distance between the nodes over a numerical variable. Here we have used this effect for <em>earliest</em> (first) and latest (last) publication dates and <em>total</em> number of publications. A <em>negative</em> result shows higher <em>similarity</em> or less distance in numerical variable (e.g., closer date of earliest or latest publication)<a href="coauthornetworkchapter.html#fnref30" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn31"><p>This means that highly prolific authors tend to collaborate with low prolific authors who are not necessarily younger because they have significant homophily in earliest and latest date of publications, i.e. academic age and seniority. This can be due to the fact that although the number of publications was increasing over time (see Figure <a href="coauthornetworkchapter.html#fig:range-of-publications-in-all-journals-networks">6.1</a>), the total number of publications for each author in the sample was highly skewed (Skewness = 5.93 which is in line with previous research <span class="citation">Akbaritabar, Casnici, and Squazzoni (<a href="#ref-akbaritabar2018conundrum">2018</a>)</span>) and the pool of potential collaborators for each author potentially included highly prolific and low prolific authors. Moreover, this can be the effect of the data gathering process. While we have looked at all articles throughout the scientific career of <em>Italian sociologists</em> and their collaborators, we could not include all articles of <em>these collaborators</em> in a one by one basis. This means that a person, either senior or junior, could appear in the sample only when s/he collaborated with an <em>Italian sociologist</em> in a Scopus tracked publication, so having a lower number of publications.<a href="coauthornetworkchapter.html#fnref31" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn32"><p>In order to compare different parameters’ effect in ERGM results, it is essential to calculate and compare the <em>odds ratio</em>. However, it is possible to compare the change in the coefficient of the <em>same parameter</em> over different models to judge the change in the importance of the parameter among different models<a href="coauthornetworkchapter.html#fnref32" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
